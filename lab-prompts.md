```

🤖 **Kiro Vibe Prompt** — Create the two Lambda functions

```text
First, describe the DynamoDB tables (workshop-customers, workshop-orders, workshop-products) to understand their key structure and attributes.

Then create two Lambda functions in a `/lambda_functions/` directory inside my root project:

1. `/lambda_functions/data_lookup/handler.py` -- A Lambda function that handles order, customer, and product lookups from DynamoDB.
   It should support three tools: `order_lookup`, `user_lookup`, and `product_lookup`.
   Use the `bedrockAgentCoreToolName` from the Lambda context to determine which tool was called.
   Use boto3 in region us-west-2.

2. `/lambda_functions/policy_retrieval/handler.py` -- A Lambda function that retrieves return policies from the Bedrock Knowledge Base.
   Read the Knowledge Base ID from SSM parameter `/app/workshop/kb/knowledge-base-id`.
   Use the Bedrock Agent Runtime `retrieve` API.
   Use region us-west-2.

For each Lambda, create a `requirements.txt` with dependencies.

Follow the Lambda function input/output format for AgentCore Gateway targets as described in:
https://docs.aws.amazon.com/bedrock-agentcore/latest/devguide/gateway-add-target-lambda.html
```

🤖 **Kiro Vibe Prompt** — Deploy Lambda functions

```text
Deploy both Lambda functions to AWS in region us-west-2.
Zip each function's code, create the Lambda functions using boto3, Use the pre-created Lambda execution role ARN from SSM parameter `/app/workshop/lambda/execution-role-arn`.
Print the Lambda ARNs after deployment.
```

🤖 **Kiro Vibe Prompt** — Test the Lambda functions directly

```text
Test the two Lambda functions we just deployed:
1. Invoke the data lookup Lambda with customer_id "C-01" to test order lookup and show the response
2. Invoke the policy retrieval Lambda with query "What is the return policy for electronics in the US?" and show the response
Use AWS CLI in region us-west-2.
```

🤖 **Kiro Vibe Prompt** — Create tool specifications

```text
Create tool specification JSON files for the AgentCore Gateway in `AgentCoreProject/tool_specs/` directory.
File names: data_lookup.json and policy_retrieval.json
Use the Lambda functions we created as the targets.
Make sure you are using the AgentCore Gateway Lambda tool spec format.
Look up the latest AWS documentation for the correct format.
Make each JSON as an array.
Do NOT include outputSchema — only name, description, and inputSchema are needed.
```

🤖 **Kiro Vibe Prompt** — Create Cognito User Pool for gateway auth

```text
Create a Cognito User Pool for the workshop gateway authentication:
- User Pool name: workshop-gateway-auth
- Create a domain prefix for OAuth endpoints
- Create a resource server with a custom scope for gateway invocation
- Create an app client configured for machine-to-machine (client_credentials) flow
- Save all credentials (user_pool_id, domain, client_id, client_secret, token_endpoint, discovery_url) to a config file - cognito_config.json
- Use the IDP-based discovery URL format: https://cognito-idp.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/{user_pool_id}/.well-known/openid-configuration
- Region: us-west-2
```

💻 **Terminal Command** — Add the Gateway (interactive)

```bash
agentcore add
```

Wizard selections (data-lookup target):
- Resource: **Gateway Target**
- Name: `data-lookup`
- Target type: **Lambda function**
- Lambda ARN: paste the Data Lookup Lambda ARN
- Tool schema file path: `./tool_specs/data_lookup.json`
- Gateway: select the gateway created above
- **Confirm**

💻 **Terminal Command** — Add the second Gateway Target (interactive)

```bash
agentcore add
```

```

🤖 **Kiro Vibe Prompt** — Test the Gateway MCP endpoint

```text
Test the AgentCore Gateway MCP endpoint.
Get the gateway URL from the agentcore configuration.
Use the Cognito credentials from cognito_config.json to obtain a JWT token, then call the gateway's /mcp endpoint to list available tools.
Show me the tools that the gateway exposes.
```

🤖 **Kiro Vibe Prompt** — Integrate gateway tools into the agent

```text
Update app/CustomerAssistantAgent/main.py to replace the dummy order_lookup, user_lookup, product_lookup, and policy_retrieval tools with real gateway tools.

The agent should connect to the AgentCore Gateway as an MCP client to discover and call the data_lookup and policy_retrieval Lambda functions.
The data_lookup Lambda handles order_lookup, user_lookup, and product_lookup calls.
Remove the dummy mock data functions.

The agent must handle OAuth token management for gateway authentication:
- Read GATEWAY_CLIENT_ID, GATEWAY_CLIENT_SECRET, GATEWAY_TOKEN_ENDPOINT, and GATEWAY_SCOPE from environment variables
- Obtain a JWT access token from Cognito using the client_credentials grant type
- Pass the token as an Authorization Bearer header when making MCP calls to the gateway URL
- Cache and auto-refresh the token before expiry

Keep the get_current_time tool and the memory integration intact.
Update agentcore.json and env.local with the gateway endpoint URL and the Cognito credentials (client_id, client_secret, token_endpoint, scope).
Look up the latest AgentCore Gateway integration documentation for the correct MCP client pattern.
Refer to https://docs.aws.amazon.com/bedrock-agentcore/latest/devguide/gateway-agent-integration.html for the Strands MCP client integration.
```

🤖 **Kiro Vibe Prompt** — Local integration tests (Kiro will run `agentcore dev` for each)

1. `agentcore dev "Look up orders for customer C-01"`
2. `agentcore dev "What is the return policy for electronics in India?"`
3. `agentcore dev "Can I return the PlayStation 5 I ordered? What's the policy for gaming consoles in India?"`
```

💻 **Terminal Command** — Redeploy

```bash
agentcore deploy
```

💻 **Terminal Command** — Invoke the deployed agent

```bash
agentcore invoke
```

💬 **Agent Test Prompt** — Combined gateway + KB

- Enable the user and set email as verified
- Use region us-west-2
```

🤖 **Kiro Vibe Prompt** — Build the Streamlit app

```text
Create a Streamlit chat application in a file called `streamlit_app.py` in /streamlit-ui/ folder under root.
The app should:

1. **Authentication with Cognito:**
   - Read the Cognito User Pool ID and App Client ID from the existing Cognito configuration files in the project
   - Show a login form with email and password fields when the user is not authenticated
     (For convinience during the workshop , use the Cognito user name and password as the default values)
   - Handle the Cognito USER_PASSWORD_AUTH flow using boto3 cognito-idp client
   - Handle the NEW_PASSWORD_REQUIRED challenge for first-time login (show a "Set New Password" form)
   - Store the authentication tokens in Streamlit session state
   - Show a logout button in the sidebar when authenticated

2. **Chat Interface:**
   - Display a chat history using `st.chat_message` components
   - Provide a chat input box at the bottom for user messages
   - When the user sends a message, invoke the deployed agent using the AgentCore Runtime API
   - Read the agent endpoint URL from the agentcore configuration
   - Display the agent's response in the chat
   - Maintain chat history in Streamlit session state

3. **AgentCore Runtime Integration:**
   - Refer to https://docs.aws.amazon.com/bedrock-agentcore/latest/devguide/runtime-invoke-agent.html
   - Use AgentCore Runtime ARN from the previous steps.
   - Use the user name (part before @) as actor_id.
   - Pass a consistent session_id per user session so the agent's memory works across messages
   - Include proper error handling for connection failures and timeouts

4. **UI Layout:**
   - Page title: "Returns & Refunds Assistant"
   - Sidebar showing: user email, session ID, and a logout button
   - Render streaming response properly. Tries to parse each chunk as JSON first. If successful, yields the parsed value (without the extra quotes) If not JSON, yields the chunk as-is
   - Welcome message when chat starts: "Hello! I'm your Returns & Refunds Assistant. I can help you look up orders, check return eligibility, calculate refunds and answer policy questions. How can I help you today?"

Use region us-west-2 for all AWS service calls.
